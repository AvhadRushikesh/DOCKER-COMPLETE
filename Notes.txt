Introducing Volumes:

Volumes are folders on your host machine-hard drive which are mounted ("mode available", mapped) into containers
Volumes persist if a container shuts down.If a container (re-)starts & mounts volume, any data inside of that volume is available in the container.
A container can write data into a volume and read data from it.
